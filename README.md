This is a repo of the non-sensitive configuration files that I use with Arch linux.

When I move computers, re-install, or make VMs it's a pain to move them over, so here
they are.

Most of the files are made by me from snippets on the internet. A few files are exact
copies, and credits are added where available. If you see something that you want
credit for please message me or submit a pull request!

This is a repo of the non-sensitive configuration files that I use with Arch linux.

When I move computers, re-install, or make VMs it's a pain to move them over, so here
they are.

If you see something you like, feel free to grab it, butcher it, use it, whatever.
But if there are credits listed please pass them along.

Most of the files are made by me from snippets on the internet. A few files are exact
copies, and credits are added where available. If you see something that you want
credit for please message me or submit a pull request!
